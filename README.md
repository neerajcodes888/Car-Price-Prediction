# Car Price Prediction ML Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the prices of cars based on various features and attributes. The model is built using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.

## Dataset

We used the "Car Price Dataset" for training and evaluating the model. You can find the dataset in the "data" directory.

- **Dataset Source**: [[Car-Price-Kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/goyalshalini93/car-price-prediction-linear-regression-rfe)]

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to run this project:


- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <gh repo clone neerajcodes888/car_price_predict>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd car-price-prediction-ml
```

3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open the `car-price-prediction.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```
car-price-prediction-ml/
  ├── data/                    # Data files (e.g., car_data.csv)
  ├── notebooks/               # Jupyter notebooks
  │   ├── car-price-prediction.ipynb   # Main notebook
  ├── README.md                # This README file
  ├── requirements.txt         # List of project dependencies
  └── .gitignore               # Git ignore file
```

## Model Evaluation

We evaluated the model using common regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R^2) to assess its performance. The results can be found in the Jupyter notebook.

## Future Work

- You can further improve the model's performance by trying different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
- Explore feature engineering techniques to enhance the model's predictive power.
- Create a web application or API to allow users to predict car prices based on input features.
